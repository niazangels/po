_A pandas-like from scratch in Python_

## What's included
- [x] `DataFrame`!
- [x] `DataFrame.dtypes`
- [X] `DataFrame.columns`
- [X] `DataFrame.shape`
- [X] `len(DataFrame)`
- [x] Single column indexing with `DataFrame["column_name"]`
- [x] Multiple column indexing with `DataFrame[["column_name", "another_column_name"]]`


## But why?
There's a good chance I will improve my software engineering skills.

And just like with [Bloo](https://github.com/niazangels/bloo), it gives me another shot at the following:
- [x] enforce myself to go the test driven development way
- [x] raise error messages that tell you exactly what's wrong
- [ ] practicing writing plenty of docstrings
- [ ] add type hinting wherever possible
